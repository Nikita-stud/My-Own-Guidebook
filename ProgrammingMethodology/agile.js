//Agile thinking, everyone on the team knows a bit of everything instead of having specialists,
//short term planning. Agile mindset. Ask tough questions, open to improvement
//!!!Since all subjects are now so deep and there are experts in certain areas thus, we need more team planning, scrum masters have to listen to everyone now

//Agile Manifesto principles: https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html
//Face to face with customer, dont switch code with others, limit amount of tasks for sprints
//20%, 80% rule, 20% of features users use 80% of the time, so focus on highest value tasks and move down
//!!!Focus on features users will use 80% of the time
//!!!Continuous delivery of valuable features, working software is the primary measure of progress, user can then always deploy it

//Product Owner has to have vision of the product and guide Scrum master

//Handoffs: code that is given to someone else
//Cone of Uncertainty: shows cost of intoducing changes at start vs the end of the project
//Silos: areas of expertise that are isolated from others
//MoSCoW: prioritization technique, must have, should have, could have, wont have
//Scrum: fail fast,framework where there is Scrum master, backlog, sprints, stakeholders inspect and we adjust
//Sprint Burndown Chart: chart in Scrum if we will reach goal within time
//MVP: Minimum Viable Product,enough functuaality to test and get feedback
//AC: Acceptance Criteria, criteria when a task based on user storey will be considered complete
//Backlog: User stories, tasks based on the stories, have backlog refinement session at midpoint of sprints
//Sprint cadence: how long are sprints, 2 weeks max
//Roadmap: guide showing all above, Kanban etc.
//Waterfall: same as Agile work but after completing a phase, we dont move back
//Belbin’s Team roles: How people work, see if they fit together test
//JIT: just in type manufacturer
//WIP: Work in Progress
//CFD: Cumulative Flow Diagrams, diagram in Kanban,

//User Stories: https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories
//As a [role], I want [feature] so that I can [benefit]
//Create a definition of "done", also give point as estimate of importance

//Kanban: signal that there is needed pull new stuff. focuses on customer valuable implementations
//        has user stories, to do, doing and done. User takes a task themselfs
//        https://www.guru99.com/kanban-interview-questions.html
//        Teams need to have set rules how to write code
//        Rules: Visualise workflow.Limit Work in Progress.Measure and manage flow, Make policies explicit,Recognise improvement opportunities
//        Smaller rules: same time size work,
//        Consists: Input,Analysis,Develop,Test,Release
//        Color: green-technical issue, yellow-user stories, red-bugs need fixing
//
//Value stream map: phases task must go through before completion
//new task is added to input
//dev has time then analysis board

//Belbin: A good team leader treats members of a team like actors on the stage. There need to be exits and entrances. Not everyone is required to be on the stage at the same time.” Dr Meredith Belbin

//Action-oriented roles:
