//HOW MY MODULES ARE ORGANIZED.. 3 ways

//Model-View-Controller (MVC) -
//Model – data on which we work
//View – visuals, the way our data is displayed: HTML and CSS part of the application;
//Controller – entire application logic.

//Model-View-Presenter (MVP) -android dev
//Model – data on which we work
//View – visuals, the way our data is displayed: HTML and CSS part of the application;
//Presenter - logic of application

//Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) -angular and react dev
//Model – data on which we work
//View – visuals, the way our data is displayed: HTML and CSS part of the application;
//VM separates stateless and stateful data into ViewModel and Model
